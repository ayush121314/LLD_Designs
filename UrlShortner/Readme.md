# 1️⃣ Overview

This project demonstrates how to design a production-ready URL shortener similar to Bitly or TinyURL.

Key goals:

* Horizontally scalable
* Low latency redirects
* Clean service separation
* Distributed-safe ID generation
* Extensible for premium features

---

# 2️⃣ System Architecture

The system is divided into logical layers:

* Controller Layer
* Write Service Layer
* Read Service Layer
* Shared Services
* Infrastructure Services

The system separates high-traffic reads from lower-traffic writes.

---

# 3️⃣ Design Principles

* Single Responsibility Principle
* Separation of Concerns
* Horizontal Scalability
* Cache-First Reads
* Database Write Consistency
* Infrastructure Decoupling
* Extensible for Future Features

---

# 5️⃣ Component Breakdown

## UrlController

Handles incoming HTTP requests.

Methods:

* createShortUrl(request)
* redirect(shortKey)

---

## WriteUrlService

Responsible for URL creation.

Responsibilities:

* Authenticate user
* Validate subscription
* Generate short key
* Persist data
* Update cache

Methods:

* createAutoShortUrl()
* createCustomShortUrl()

---

## ReadUrlService

Responsible for resolving short URLs.

Responsibilities:

* Check cache
* Fallback to DB replica
* Update cache

Method:

* resolve(shortKey)

---

## SnowflakeService

Generates distributed unique IDs.

Fields:

* workerId
* lastTimestamp
* sequence

Method:

* generateId()

---

## AuthService

Validates authentication tokens.

Method:

* validateToken(token)

---

## SubscriptionService

Checks user premium status.

Method:

* isPremium(userId)

---

## UrlRepository

Handles database interactions.

Methods:

* insert(shortUrl)
* findByShortKey(shortKey)

---

## CacheService

Wraps Redis interaction.

Methods:

* get(shortKey)
* set(shortKey, longUrl)

---

# 6️⃣ Data Model

## ShortUrl

Fields:

* shortKey
* longUrl
* ownerTier
* type
* createdAt
* expiresAt

---

## User

Fields:

* userId
* tier

---

# 7️⃣ URL Creation Flow

1. Client sends request
2. Controller forwards to WriteUrlService
3. Token validated via AuthService
4. If custom alias → check SubscriptionService
5. If auto-generated → SnowflakeService generates ID
6. Base62 encoding applied
7. URL stored in Primary DB
8. Cache updated
9. Response returned

---

# 8️⃣ Redirect Flow

1. Client requests short URL
2. Controller calls ReadUrlService
3. Cache lookup performed
4. If hit → redirect
5. If miss → query DB replica
6. Cache updated
7. HTTP 302 redirect returned

---

# 9️⃣ Distributed ID Generation (Snowflake)

Snowflake generates unique 64-bit IDs using:

* Timestamp
* Worker ID
* Sequence number

Benefits:

* No database round-trip
* Horizontally scalable
* Unique across instances

Worker ID assigned via ZooKeeper or service registry.

---

# 🔟 Scaling Strategy

## Horizontal Scaling

* Multiple WriteUrlService instances
* Multiple ReadUrlService instances

## Database Scaling

* Primary for writes
* Replicas for reads

## Cache Scaling

* Redis cluster
* TTL-based eviction

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ Caching Strategy

Cache-Aside Pattern:

Read:

* Check cache
* If miss → DB → update cache

Write:

* Write to DB
* Update cache

Benefits:

* Reduces DB load
* Low latency redirects

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ Database Design

Table: short_urls

Columns:

* short_key (PRIMARY KEY)
* long_url
* owner_tier
* type
* created_at
* expires_at

Index:

* short_key (unique index)

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ Custom Alias & Premium Flow

Custom aliases require premium subscription.

Flow:

1. Validate user
2. Check subscription
3. Verify alias availability
4. Insert into DB
5. Cache update

Premium logic separated from payment logic.
